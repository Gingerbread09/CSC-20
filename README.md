Programming Concepts and Methodology II

Topics Covered
- Object-Oriented Techniques  
  Application of object-oriented principles for systematic problem analysis and design. This includes the use of classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- Program Design  
  Emphasis on creating larger programs using abstraction to simplify and manage complexity. This involves creating clear, structured designs and using object-oriented design patterns.
- Algorithm Analysis and Big-O Notation  
  Introduction to algorithm analysis, focusing on efficiency. Big-O notation was used to evaluate the time and space complexity of algorithms.
- Advanced Language Features  
  Exploration of advanced programming language features such as interfaces, abstract classes, and generics to improve code reusability and scalability.
- Basic Sorting and Searching Algorithms  
  Implementation of key algorithms like bubble sort, merge sort, and binary search, and an understanding of their complexities and use cases.
- Recursion  
  Study of recursive techniques, understanding how to break down problems into smaller sub-problems, and implementing recursive algorithms.

Semester Deliverables 

- Semester-Long Project  
  The course was structured around a semester-long project, encouraging us to approach programming in a systematic and organized manner, while applying all concepts learned during the semester.

- Managing Program Complexity  
  Focused on using abstraction and proper design techniques to manage the complexity of larger projects, ensuring code readability, maintainability, and scalability.

- Testing and Documentation  
  Strong emphasis on testing strategies and documentation to ensure the correctness and clarity of code. We used unit tests, wrote detailed comments, and documented each stage of the project.

Goals and Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, I gained practical experience in applying object-oriented principles to real-world problems, writing clean, maintainable, and efficient code, and analyzing algorithms for performance using Big-O notation. This project provided a strong foundation for tackling complex programming tasks and developing software systematically.
